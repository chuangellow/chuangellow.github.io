I am a second-year graduate student at National Taiwan University, pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science. Prior to this, I earned my Bachelor of Science degree from the same university. My research focus lies in the field of AI compiler and model compression, specifically aimed at accelerating model inference time. This interest was further nurtured during my tenure as a Research Assistant at Academia Sinica in Taiwan, where I was actively involved in relevant projects and research endeavors.

Currentl I am working with [Prof. Pang-Feng Liu](https://sites.google.com/view/pangfengliu/home) and [Dr. Ding-Yong Hong](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/dyhong/vita_zh.html) in the [Parallel and Distributed Processing Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/ntucsiepdpl/home).
